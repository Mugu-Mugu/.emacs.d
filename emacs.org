**** DONE Wgrep wrapper
CLOSED: [2019-03-23 sam. 12:07]
**** Better configuration logic
***** Etat des lieux
- use-package with light configuration
  powerline / emacs libs
- global framework
  flycheck
- wrapping with multiple package integration
  org mode / shell / workspace : persp & projectile
- lazy integration
  fast loading for evrything
***** Package
- feature
  - realize an objective
  - may use direct package without any configuration or a collection of packages without common initialization
  - may use a collection of packages that requires a common configuration initialisation and lazy thing
  - manage the lazy loading
- libs
  - no configuration logic, just direct require
  - no automatic actions, just function
- example
**** Helm vs ivy :
***** For helm
- multi action
- multi source (big + for an agenda like)
- much more actions
- not enough
***** For ivy
- much better find_file/find_dir (but how often do i use it now with the improved projectile persp)
- simpler to configure?
- more extensions?
**** DONE ruby rspec integration
CLOSED: [2019-02-02 sam. 22:00]
- launch test current buffer
- launch test project

**** DONE Melpa to Straight
**** CANCELLED [#B] projectile windows configuration
